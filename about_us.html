            <h1>About US</h1>
            <p> Life always gets more complicated. When we were young children, schedules were created by adults. In elementary school, you go to school, 
                listen to your teachers, ride the school bus home, and then do whatever aligns with what your parents believe is appropriate for your age. As we get older, however, life becomes more and more of a balancing act. In college, you balance academics, a social life, extracurriculars, and possible work. You have more freedom to do what you want; however, you only have a limited amount of time to do it. It is easy to get overwhelmed with deadlines, fomo (fear of missing out), and burn out.
                 The goal of ClassyCal is to help create an effective schedule  for college students in order to manage their time wisely.
                The website uses prompts that the user asks a AI Chatbot, such as ChatGPT, in order to create a schedule, then have them put it into the calendar website.</p>
